### üëã Hey there, I'm Christian!

I'm a **Cloud Engineer** with a foundation built on a deep understanding of infrastructure as code, automation, and solution design. My journey from a Virtual Assistant taught me a unique skill: building scalable, efficient systems while focusing on the end-user experience. Now, I leverage that perspective to engineer robust and cost-effective cloud solutions.
